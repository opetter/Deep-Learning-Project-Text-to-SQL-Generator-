# Deep-Learning-Project-Text-to-SQL-Generator-
A deep learning project that utilizes advanced transformer architecture to generate SQL queries from plain English inputs, helping bridge the gap between technical and non-technical teams! 

Have you ever found yourself wishing you could just tell your database what you need without wrestling with complex SQL syntax? My project aims to bridge that gap, making data querying as simple as chatting in English.
Text generation can often be a difficult output to measure in deep learning models. I took a simplistic approach focusing on the output of key SQL functions. I would greatly appreciate some feedback and insights on how you would approach assessing these models!
